This is my resources for ELC tablet and controlling it though home assistant, documents are uploaded in open office format

If you find any more information these tablets, or building a better android version for these tablet get a hold of me I would like to have a known good android build to replace the vendor provided image, it does seem to be able to atleast boot the google GSI image i will be looking into this as an option as i work on getting mine fixed the firmware update the seller shared to me broke wifi/bluetooth trying to get that resolved before playing with GSI images. as i will need a userdebug compiled version of GSI to continue to have adb root.
