My Resouces for ELC Tablets, and Home Assistitant

This is my resources for ELC tablet and controlling it though home assistant, documents are uploaded in open office format

If you find any more information these tablets, or building a better android version for these tablet get a hold of me I would like to have a known good android build to replace the vendor provided image, it does seem to be able to atleast boot the google GSI image i will be looking into this as an option as i work on getting mine fixed the firmware update the seller shared to me broke wifi/bluetooth trying to get that resolved before playing with GSI images. as i will need a userdebug compiled version of GSI to continue to have adb root.
